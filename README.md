# My V0 Project

Welcome to **My V0 Project**! This is a Next.js project built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit for state management. It also integrates React Leaflet for map functionality. Below are clear instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for cloning the repository)

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-v0-project.git
cd my-v0-project
```

If you're not using Git, you can download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

---

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Install all the required dependencies using npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

---

### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. For example:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_API_KEY=your_map_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_map_api_key_here` with your actual API key for the map service (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.).

---

### **4. Run the Development Server**

Start the development server to run the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### **5. Build and Start for Production**

To build the project for production and start the server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

or

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

The production build will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. Map Not Showing**
- Ensure the map container has a defined height and width.
- Verify that the API key is correctly set in `.env.local`.
- Check the browser console for errors.

### **2. TypeScript Errors**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
- Run `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` to check for TypeScript issues.

### **3. Dependency Issues**
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), then reinstall dependencies:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```
